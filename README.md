# Dexter

Ever wondered if you could talk to your computer in your natural language, and it writes the code for you, and that too in your favorite language?

#### Dexter is an AI-based code editor that allows you to code parallely in Javascript and Python just by conversing with it. It supports two of the most widely used languages in the country, Hindi and English.

## For the computer professionals
Typing on keyboard for long hours can cause long term injuries for developers. [According to a study](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/rsi.html##book), individuals who type for more than two to four hours a day are at a high risk of getting RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury). 

In addition to RSI, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (a stress-related injury caused by repetitive movement of joints) is very common among Computer professionals due to poorly placed computer components and extensive typing over a long period of time.

## Elevating Accessibility
This project is all about accessibility, it aims to make it easier for people with disabilities to code and express themselves.
People with partial or complete blindness can code with their voices and have the generated code read out to them.
People who do not have the dexterity to type, like people with injuries to their hands, or muscular dystrophy patients can code at the speed of thought with Dexter.

## Keep track of the changes with Zulip Chat bot
All the changes you do to the files, are tracked and sent to a zulip channel to keep track of all the changes you do.
Optionally, the changes can be read out to you as they go in, a feature that can be utilized by people with limited vision.
